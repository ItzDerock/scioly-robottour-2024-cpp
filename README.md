# Science Olympiad - Robot Tour

An Arduino version of [my other attempt](https://github.com/ItzDerock/scioly-robottour-2024) that was aimed at the RP2040 micocontroller. The RP2040 uses 3.3v and I do not have the components on hand currently to build a voltage divider so I will temporarily use an Arduino Uno to build the project. My hope is to eventually rebuild this in Rust as a learning excercise and target the RP2040.

Better README soon when (and if) I finish.
